    <string name="welcome_msg">Hi! Thank you for downloading the application %1$s\n\tWe are currently in the main menu. Here you can choose a set of cards, number of players, time per round and languages. You can turn off the language option if you want to play traditional memory.\n\tTo change the set of cards, move the picture to the right or left.\n\tTo change the language, press the flag and select a new one (different sets of cards have different languages)\n\tIn the right bottom corner You can go to settings.\n\tUnfortunately I have not completed any philology so translations into languages other than Polish and English may contain errors because the translation was done by Uncle Google %2$s\n\tIf you are interested in volunteering and would like to translate a set of cards into a new language or correct the current translation, please contact with: %3$s</string>

    <string name="first_game_msg">\tThis is what the game board looks like. If you\'ve never played memory before, the main goal of the game is to collect as many pairs as possible. Each card has a picture and there is a second card on the board that matches it. Each player in his turn reveals 2 cards if they are the same, he gets another chance, if not the next player starts the next turn. Simple!\n\tDepending on your phone and android version, some languages may not work. \n\t(Tip: if you accidentally mistook the queue then holding down the name of the player will go to his queue)</string>
